# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial repository scaffold: `README.md`, `LICENSE` (MIT), `CHANGELOG.md`, `.gitignore`.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant 2.1).
- ADR-0001: "What is gunk?" — locks the product thesis (local-only, drop-in,
  Swift macOS app + short-lived TypeScript MCP server, no daemon).
- ADR-0002: "Stack and runtime" — Swift/SwiftUI for `gunk.app`, TypeScript on
  Bun for `gunk-mcp`, shared SQLite store at `~/.gunk/store.db`. No daemon,
  no IPC socket.
- ADR-0003: "Ambient over invoked" — locks the principle that the happy-path
  user types zero commands. The CLI is plumbing, not product.
- ADR-0004: "Drag-in over file-watch" — locks the principle that gunk only
  knows about folders the user explicitly drops on the app. No filesystem
  watching, no Full Disk Access, no path config in v0.
- `docs/roadmap.md` — 9-week phased plan, walking-skeleton-first.

### Changed
- Pivoted from a CLI-first product framing to an ambient/background system
  before any code was written. README and ADR-0001 rewritten to match.
- Removed all references to a public/shared marketplace from v0 scope. Gunk
  is local-only at launch.
- Dropped the long-lived `gunkd` daemon from the architecture. The MCP
  server is now spawned by AI tools using the standard MCP stdio pattern,
  and the macOS app does ingestion/classification work in-process. Two
  processes total, sharing a SQLite store. (See ADR-0002.)
- Dropped the filesystem-watching design. Gunk now ingests only folders the
  user explicitly drops on the app. (See ADR-0004.)
